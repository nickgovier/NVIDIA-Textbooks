# NVIDIA Textbooks

NVIDIA has published the content of some of their older graphics programming textbooks online, but in HTML form. Here you can find conversions of those webpages into LaTeX, which can then be used to create PDFs, e.g. at overleaf.com.

I applaud NVIDIA for publishing the contents of these books online, but they should really be in a form that can be viewed offline, fully searchable in one place (rather than as individual web pages per chapter), and preserved in case NVIDIA decide to pull the web server plug in the future. They have already suffered from digital deterioration and feature some broken links, where the content has presumably been moved around the website but not updated correctly.

All rights to the content here remains with NVIDIA. You can still buy printed versions of these books, and download any accompanying software, at the links below.
