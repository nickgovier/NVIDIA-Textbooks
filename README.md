# NVIDIA Textbooks

NVIDIA has published the content of some of their older graphics programming textbooks online, but in HTML form. Here you can find conversions of those webpages into LaTeX, which can then be used to create PDFs, e.g. at overleaf.com.

I applaud NVIDIA for publishing the contents of these books online, but they should do so in a form that can be viewed offline, fully searchable in one place (rather than as individual web pages per chapter), and preserved in case future NVIDIA decides to pull the web server plug. They have already suffered from digital deterioration, featuring some broken links where the content has presumably been moved around the website but not updated correctly, and feature tables which are plainly incorrect, as the HTML layout does not reflect the original layout of the book.  These errors have been corrected in this LaTeX conversion.

All rights to the content here remains with NVIDIA. You can still buy printed versions of these books, and download any accompanying software, at the links below.
